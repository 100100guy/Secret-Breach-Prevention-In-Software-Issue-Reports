views are accumulating across less sessions.\r\n\r\nThis means less distinct sessions are being created, which means something is making session ids be the same across different arguments.\r\n\r\nThe arguments used to generate the session UUID are `websiteId, hostname, ip, userAgent` and haven't changed:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/umami-software/umami/blob/784237bfab6da8c960efac7fd1073b8e0f67dfd9/src/lib/session.ts#L66-L69\r\n\r\nI checked how they're collected and it also hasn't changed (location data has changed, but they're not used in the UUID):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/umami-software/umami/blob/784237bfab6da8c960efac7fd1073b8e0f67dfd9/src/lib/detect.ts#L124-L137\r\n\r\n_Edit: the below is irrelevant, please read the next comment for the real issue_\r\n\r\nThe only thing that changed related to this that I found was that a monthly `salt()` was added as an argument to the hash that gets encoded into the UUID:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/umami-software/umami/blob/784237bfab6da8c960efac7fd1073b8e0f67dfd9/src/lib/crypto.ts#L9-L19\r\n\r\nThis happened in [this commit](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/commit/f175534f5120bcbf807d2421b5232d48e102f261) trying to fix [this issue](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/issues/2311) and was released with v2.9.0.\r\n\r\nI don't know how this could cause the problem, but it's the only related change that I found. Any other ideas?\r\n\r\n### Database\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umami-software/umami/issues/2492/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umami-software/umami/issues/2492/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umami-software/umami/issues/2488","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umami-software/umami","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umami-software/umami/issues/2488/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umami-software/umami/issues/2488/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umami-software/umami/issues/2488/events","html_url":"https://github.com/umami-software/umami/issues/2488","id":2107214385,"node_id":"I_kwDOELYDsM59mYox","number":2488,"title":"self-host API get could not working","user":{"login":"mobeicanyue","id":81098819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDk4ODE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81098819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobeicanyue","html_url":"https://github.com/mobeicanyue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobeicanyue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobeicanyue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobeicanyue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobeicanyue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobeicanyue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobeicanyue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobeicanyue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobeicanyue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobeicanyue/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2024-01-30T08:19:37Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T12:58:38Z","closed_at":"2024-01-31T12:58:38Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Describe the Bug\n\nthe documentation mention\r\n![image](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/assets/81098819/b878aa92-9022-4e54-92a3-95c29bfa4637)\r\n\r\nand I try to get it\r\n![image](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/assets/81098819/ab0230de-4f89-4805-9a31-74babc06a593)\r\n\r\nI do not know why and I could not find any `api-key` in my admin page, except tracking code.\r\nAnd I make this site's umami statistics public.\r\nHope someone could help me\n\n### Database\n\nMySQL\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Which browser are you using?

What I have divined this far is:\r\n\r\n1. I'm running umami on port 3000 on a webserver behind a reverse proxy.\r\n2. the dashboard renders fine and dandy\r\n3. umami.js is served fine and dandy\r\n4. umami.js attempts to access /api/collect which is returning 404.\r\n\r\ntherein lies my momentary conundrum, to look more closely at another day. But for now, I log it in hope of some creative feedback or thoughts. I doubt I have an umami bug here, much more likely an installation bug. I have pulled and built and restarted but no improvement. \r\n\r\nWhat's puzzling me is that during the build a lot of routes are tested and a lot of /api/ routes but not /api/collect. \r\n\r\nAlso on the console I'm console the failure is: XHROPTIONS   ....

visits `https://example.com/google`, then it should redirect to `google.com` but doesn't get tracked.\r\n\r\ni tested it by adding a bit of timeout & it gets tracked. i've tested it & only from 1.5 seconds, it starts working. but i've made the delay to be `2` because i think it depends on loading the script & that depends on network a particular user is using. idk if i can track it like url

from \"react\"\r\n\r\nconst delay = 2\r\n\r\nconst Guide = () => {\r\n\tconst { guide } = useParams()\r\n\tconst [show, setShow] = React.useState(true)\r\n\r\n\tReact.useEffect(() => {\r\n\t\tlet
