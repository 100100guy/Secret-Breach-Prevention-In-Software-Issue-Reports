First of all, thank you for delivering a great project. Yesterday I've decided to build a blog on top of Firebase, just for fun. Because server rendering is important for a blogging system, I've decided to go for `now`.

I've followed the instructions, and I've created this `pages/index.js`
```
import React from 'react';
import Firebase from 'firebase';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: ""AIzaSyD2_7iHrpdlCp8CDWlCKUxPcdeqeSlrkJU"",
  authDomain: ""blog-b3c36.firebaseapp.com"",
  databaseURL: ""https://blog-b3c36.firebaseio.com"",
  storageBucket: ""blog-b3c36.appspot.com"",
  messagingSenderId: ""117409352414""
};

const blogApp = Firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
blogApp.database().ref('blog/articles').set('test');

export default () => <div>Hello world, this is gonna be an awesome Firebase blog!</div>
```
(The apiKey is valid and permissions are set for everybody to write/read so you that anyone can debug this)

Everything worked fine till the point where I had a typo in my app, then it warned about the error and after fixing it I've received: 

```
Error: Firebase App named '[DEFAULT]' already exists.

    at Module.require (module.js:500:17)
    at require (internal/module.js:20:19)
```

I've tried to put it to a separate file, nothing helped. The question is, is there any way I can avoid certain parts of my code from being refreshed? Or do you have any tips how could Firebase integration be done in `now`?",AIzaSyD2_7iHrpdlCp8CDWlCKUxPcdeqeSlrkJU,https://github.com/vercel/vercel
