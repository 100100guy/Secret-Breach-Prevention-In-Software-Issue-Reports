With cloud services that are accessed through tokens & keys becoming the de-facto Internet infrastructure, such bots can put developers at ease while filing reports.","This is not related to the bot ability, but perhaps highlighting the secret may help in long reports.","Some repositories have strict rules for issue reporting, which benefit both them and the users. Maybe a bot can check if a issue follows these rules of a repository."

mubasshira31@gmail.com,MubasshiraMusarrat,4,1,4,3,4,5,5,5,5,4,4,It was very helpful. I didn't have to undergo all the lines of text one by one. Very convenient ,I had to wait for a while before the green dot turned red. If the bot could underline the lines or portion that has a breach inside the texts rather that showing it in a popup it would have been a bit more convenient as I wouldn't have had to search for it throughout.,

It can pinpoint the leaks (I am not sure if it already does this now, because on my end I could not see the specific red underlines, the red dot at the top right corner was available though). 
2. It can also suggest the final issue after removing the flawed part. Otherwise, while removing the secret, the remaining message or code snippet might not be meaningful/working. ",I cannot think of any.
