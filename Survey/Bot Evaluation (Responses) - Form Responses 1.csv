When debugging, the urgency to fix an issue may lead to sharing sensitive information without proper review. Sometimes, it's a lack of awareness about which data are considered sensitive.

Several factors could lead to sharing secrets in issue reports, such as oversight during debugging, unfamiliarity with best security practices, urgency to resolve issues quickly, or misunderstanding the potential risks of exposing sensitive information. Developers may unintentionally include secrets like API keys, database credentials, or access tokens while sharing code snippets or logs. Additionally, misconfigurations, lack of proper documentation, or not using environment variables to manage secrets securely can also contribute to inadvertent exposure. Without proper security training or tools to detect sensitive information, these incidents can occur more frequently.","Warning tools like your bot are essential in preventing secret breaches, as they provide automated detection and alerts for sensitive information before it’s shared publicly.
