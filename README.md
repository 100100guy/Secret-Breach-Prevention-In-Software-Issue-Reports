## **Secret Breach Prevention in Software Issue Reports**

### Overview  
This project focuses on **preventing secret breaches** in software issue reports by utilizing a combination of **pre-trained language models** (BERT, RoBERTa) and **regex-based detection techniques**. Accidental disclosure of sensitive information, such as API keys, tokens, or passwords, can pose serious security risks. To address this, we developed models and tools that automatically detect and prevent such breaches in real-time.

---

## **Benchmark Dataset**  
We curated a new **benchmark dataset of 25,000 issue reports**, containing **437 instances with confirmed secret breaches**.  
- You can access the dataset [here](#).  

This dataset serves as the foundation for evaluating **regex-based detection tools** and **language models**.

---

## **Language Models**  
To improve the detection accuracy, we implemented and compared various **pre-trained language models**, including:  
- **BERT**  
- **RoBERTa**  
- **Electra**  
- **SpanBERT**  

These models help filter out false positives generated by regex-based detection. The models were trained and evaluated on **Google Colab** and **local machines**.  
- To replicate the experiments, upload the **Python notebooks** from this package and the **dataset** to **Google Drive**, and open them in **Google Colab**.

---

## **Experimentation on Real-World Repositories**  
We tested the models on **real-world GitHub repositories** to validate their performance in real scenarios.  
- Crawling codes for fetching issue reports are available in the **`crawler`** folder.

---

## **SBMBot: Real-Time Secret Breach Detection Tool**  
We extended our models into a browser extension called **SBMBot**.  
- **SBMBot** offers **real-time, context-aware warnings** to users while they create issue reports, helping prevent accidental disclosures of sensitive information.  
- **Frontend code** is available in the **`SBMBot-Extension`** folder.  
- **Backend code** can be found in the **`SBMBot-Backend`** folder.

---

## **Survey of Software Developers**  
We conducted a **survey with 30 software developers** to gather insights into the challenges of preventing secret breaches in issue reports.  
- **Survey questionnaire** and **responses** are available in the **`Survey`** folder.  
- The folder also contains a **qualitative and quantitative analysis** of the survey data.

## **How to Use**  
1. **Dataset and Models:**  
   - Upload the **benchmark dataset** and **notebooks** to **Google Colab** or run them locally.  
2. **Browser Extension:**  
   - Install the **SBMBot** extension to enable secret breach prevention in GitHub issue reports. Installation and usage tutorial can be found [here](https://youtu.be/rvaP-ddnfv8). 
3. **Crawler:**  
   - Use the **issue_crawler.ipynb** code from **crawler**  to fetch issue reports from real repositories for experimentation. SOme of the repositories used in the experiments are mentioned in the crawled_repos.txt file.

## **Contributions**  
1. **Benchmark Dataset Creation**:  
   - Curated a new benchmark dataset of **25,000 issue reports**, including **437 instances** with confirmed secret breaches.

2. **Assessment and Enhancement of Regex-based Tools**:  
   - Evaluated existing **regex-based tools** for secret breach detection.  
   - Enhanced their accuracy through **pre-processing** techniques and **pre-trained language models**.

3. **Language Model Implementation and Comparison**:  
   - Implemented and compared various **pre-trained language models**.  
   - These models were used to **filter out false positives** identified by regex-based detection.

4. **SBMBot Browser Extension**:  
   - Developed **SBMBot**, a browser extension providing **real-time feedback** to prevent secret breaches when creating GitHub issues.  
   - SBMBot helps users mitigate secret breaches by detecting sensitive content during issue report creation.
